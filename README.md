# CSE_1284_AW


This is my journey through the CSE 1284 at Mississippi State University 

Folder layout:
  Exercises:
        Goes from week zero to the last week. 
        Each task has comments in the file on what the task is and what is expected to learn in said task. 

  Labs:   
        Every week (Sometimes every 2 weeks) has a lab. Each Lab will have a serparate text file (coming later) explaing the challenge. 


Each task or lab has a comments in the file about the task or a seprate text file explaining the callenges and tasks. (I have not decided which to do yet or if i want to do a mix of both)
