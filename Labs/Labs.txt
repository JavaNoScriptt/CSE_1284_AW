Lab 1:

The main objective is to take what is learned in weeks 0-2 and put it into practice. Which is 


Problem statement:

You work for a mapping software company. You have been tasked with showing someone a small map of the houses on their street.
All houses on the street have house numbers that are three digits long, ie. 300, 508, 471. All street run east/west (horizontal).
All houses with even numbers are on one side of the street (could be north or south). 
All houses with odd numbers are across the street on the other side (could be south or north). 
House numbers to the west (left) decrease by 2. House numbers increase by 2 to the east (right).
 A house to the south has a house number 1 higher than a house to the north.

Sample run:

Lab 2:

The objective is to learn from weeks 3-5. 


Problem statemnt:

Create the design for determining if a point is inside, on, or outside of the rectangle. 
Drawing out the rectangle and labeling the coordinates of all points will help you to visualize the problem. 

Test example:
'
Enter the x coordinate for the lower left corner of the rectangle:    1
Enter the y coordinate for the lower left corner of the rectangle:    1

Enter the width of the rectangle:    5
Enter the height of the rectangle:    3

Enter the x coordinate of the point:    2
Enter the y coordinate of the point:    1
On the rectangle

Lab 3:
Objective is to use math to determine different outcomes. 
Problem Statement: 
To complete this week's lab, you will be given 3 inputs which represent a possible triangle, 
and you need to determine if those three inputs would construct a right triangle. If the 3 sides do not form a right triangle, 
then you will need to determine if they form a triangle at all. 
You will not know which input of the three given is the measurement of the longest side, however.

The formula to determine if 3 lengths form a right triangle is to see if the short side squared + 
the other short side squared equals the long side squared.

Sample run:

Lab 4:

Objective is to practice going over loops and list. 

Problem statement: 
Given a line of text as input, output the number of characters excluding spaces, periods, exclamation points, or commas. 


Sample Run:

'
Listen, Mr. Jones, calm down.

 Problem statement: Given a line of text as input, output the number of characters excluding spaces, periods, exclamation points, or commas. 

 Sample run:
 input: "Listen, Mr. Jones, calm down."
 output: 21



Lab 5:
  Problem statement: Write a computer program that simulates the gambling game Roulette. 
  In addition to creating the game, you will need to implement a gambling strategy called the "Martingale Strategy."

  Notes: 0 is not considered even for this excersize. The only way that the program 'bets' is on odds.
  There is nothing to do with Blacks/Reds/Greens or the range of the number.

  Sample Run:
  '
  Profit Goal: 1500
  Starting money: 1000
  Table minimum bet: 25
  Table maximum bet: 300
  Spin: 16. You lost $25 on the bet. You had 100. Now you have 75 left.
  Spin: 22. You lost $50 on the bet. You had 75. Now you have 25 left.
  Spin: 33. You won $25 on the bet. You had 25. Now you have 50 left.
  Spin: 1. You won $25 on the bet. You had 50. Now you have 75 left.
  Spin: 29. You won $25 on the bet. You had 75. Now you have 100 left.
  Spin: 15. You won $25 on the bet. You had 100. Now you have 125 left.
  Spin: 3. You won $25 on the bet. You had 125. Now you have 150 left.
  You reached your goal and beat the casino. You should stop now. You have $150.
