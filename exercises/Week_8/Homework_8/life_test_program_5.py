# life_test_program_5
#
# This program tests the playOneTurn function.
#
# You may modify this test program. This file will NOT be graded.
# Only the code in life_module.py gets graded.



# you must import the life module to test playOneTurn
import life_module


# IMPORTANT!!!
#
# You must have these four functions working correctly before
# you try implementing and testing playOneTurn
#
# - gridToString
# - gridSwap
# - countLiveNeighbors
# - updateGrid
#
# Go read the instructions in the body of playOneTurn
# in the file life_module.py before implementing playOneTurn.



# Give some initial values to the previous and current grids.
#
# IMPORTANT: At the beginning of the game, put you initial values
#            in the current grid. Fill the previous grid with zeroes.

# TODO - you write this code



# Print your initial grid (the current grid)

# TODO - you write this code



# Now you can call playOneTurn.
# It should swap grids, update the current grid, print the current grid,
# and then print a blank line (see file life_module.py).

# TODO - you write this code



# If you want to play a full game of life,
# just write a loop that calls playOneTurn, like this.
#
# lifeSteps = 5
# for step in range( lifeSteps ):
#     life_module.playOneTurn()
